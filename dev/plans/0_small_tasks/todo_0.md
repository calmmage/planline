- [ ] add readme.md
- [x] add dev_readme.md - how to init nextjs project etc.

- [x] rename 'v0 App' ("Create Next App") -> 'Planline'

- [x] change default tick count to 10 or 50

- [ ] add a new dev slider - timeline vertical size.

## Bugs
- Days view is still broken.
  - [ ] add a new 'hour' zone - but don't switch to it or show it in buttons. Use for sub-ticks only.
- Labels overlap each other
- Zones positions are broken
- Why does 'dark mode' switch only timeline view block?

## Ideas for big components

- Add scale preset buttons (day, month, week etc) - 
  - Clearly write that current buttons chage tick axes, not scale. Put them separately


## Roadmap what I am doing

- 1) Zones

- 2)
