Idea:

- [ ] Move current 'ticks' switch buttons to a separate 
  - hide them in a side panel, once auto-switch is re-enabled
- [ ] Add new scale preset buttons - switching to week / month / quarter / year / decade to fit on the screen
  - calculate proper scales using our formula func (based on screen size)
