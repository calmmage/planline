- [ ] add readme.md
- [x] add dev_readme.md - how to init nextjs project etc.

- [x] rename 'v0 App' ("Create Next App") -> 'Planline'

- [x] change default tick count to 10 or 50

- [x] add a new dev slider - timeline vertical size.

## Bugs

- Days view is still broken.
  - [ ] add a new 'hour' zone - but don't switch to it or show it in buttons. Use for sub-ticks only.
- Labels overlap each other
- Zones positions are broken
- Why does 'dark mode' switch only timeline view block?
- For some crazy reason, Year, Quarter and Month ticks are misaligned.. Troubleshoot and fix.

## Ideas for big components

- Add scale preset buttons (day, month, week etc) -
  - Clearly write that current buttons chage tick axes, not scale. Put them separately
- Fix events locations and sizes
  - Put events into zones correctly
  - Dynamically determine event height and vertical position - to fit all events in the zone

## Roadmap what I am doing

- [x] 0. dev switcher for timeline component width?
- [x] 0.1) fix dark mode switcher
  - [x] cleanup old switcher
  - [x] make colors nicer - "bg-gray-900 text-white" : "bg-white text-black"}`}> was good
  - [x] consider making it a switcher again?
- [x] 1. Zones -> show.
- 2. Switch to log scale
- [x] 3. Fix zones (events) locations
- 4. Auto-switch ticks
- [x] 5. improve events style: set opacity Â±80% by deafult. Add rounded corners. Add shadow, border.

What do I want to achieve?

- So that I can use the app and not be annoyed.
  - a) click to create an event
  - b) drag to move the event dates
  - c) Name of event (text) - clip, not overflow to next line
  - d) Less opacity by default

Questions in my mind

- How do we actually tweak tailwind styles / colors?

## Incoming tasks

- [ ] auto-correct eevent colors for dark mode?
- [ ] tweak the colors some more?
  - [ ] add borders for bottom and top bars?
  - [ ] can we use different colors / some bg picture for the timeline?
  - [ ] shake up the colors some more?
