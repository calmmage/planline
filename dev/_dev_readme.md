# Developer README

This document provides instructions on how to initialize a Next.js project and includes basic quickstart instructions.

## Initializing a Next.js Project

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 12.22.0 or later).

2. Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

   \`\`\`
   npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
   \`\`\`

   Replace \`my-next-app\` with your desired project name.

3. Answer the prompts to configure your project. You can choose TypeScript, ESLint, and other options based on your preferences.

4. Once the installation is complete, navigate to your project directory:

   \`\`\`
   cd my-next-app
   \`\`\`

## Quickstart Instructions

1. Start the development server:

   \`\`\`
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

2. Open your browser and visit \`http://localhost:3000\` to see your application.

3. Edit \`app/page.tsx\` (or \`app/page.js\` if not using TypeScript) to make changes to the main page.

4. Create new pages by adding files to the \`app\` directory. For example, \`app/about/page.tsx\` will create an "/about" route.

5. To add API routes, create files in the \`app/api\` directory. For example, \`app/api/hello/route.ts\` will create an API route at "/api/hello".

6. Use \`npm run build\` to create a production build.

7. Use \`npm start\` to run the production build locally.

Remember to consult the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more detailed information and advanced features.
